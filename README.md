# Linear Regression Analysis

## Overview

`linearregression.py` is a Python script for performing linear regression analysis. The script models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation. It can be used for predictions, analyzing relationships, or understanding data trends.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses data
- Trains a linear regression model
- Makes predictions on test data
- Evaluates model performance
- Visualizes results with plots

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your data is in CSV format with features and target variables.

2. **Update Script**: Modify the `data.csv` filename and feature columns in the script if necessary.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python linearregression.py
    ```

4. **View Results**: The script will output the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score, and display a plot of true values vs. predicted values.

## Example

To use with your dataset:

- Place your data in a file named `data.csv` with columns for features and target variable.
- Adjust the `X` and `y` variables in the script to match your dataset columns.

# Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

`sentimentanalysis.py` is a Python script designed to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. It classifies text into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. The script can be applied to various use cases including analyzing reviews, social media comments, or customer feedback.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses text data
- Trains a sentiment analysis model
- Evaluates model performance
- Predicts sentiment of new text

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your data is in CSV format with columns for text and sentiment labels.

2. **Update Script**: Modify the `sentiment_data.csv` filename and column names in the script if necessary.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python sentimentanalysis.py
    ```

4. **View Results**: The script will output accuracy, a classification report, and predictions for any new text.

## Example

To use with your dataset:

- Place your data in a file named `sentiment_data.csv` with columns `text` and `sentiment`.
- Adjust the column names in the script to match your dataset if necessary.
